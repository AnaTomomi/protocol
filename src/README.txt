# protocol
This folder contains source code for pilot analysis referenced in "Effects of daily environmental, physiological, and lifestyle factors in functional brain connectivity".

There are two folders here:
* behavioral: contains source code for the analysis of behavioral data.
* fmri: contains source code for the analysis of fmri data.

Most code is documented. If several steps are required, the name of the files contain the word "step_#". If this is the case, the steps should be run sequentially.
