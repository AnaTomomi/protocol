This GIT contains all materials referenced in "Effects of daily environmental, physiological, and lifestyle factors in functional brain connectivity".

There are four folders in this GIT:
* data: contains data if it has been pseudononymized. Some data may be missing in this folder because it is not yet pseudononymized or because it is too big for sharing on GIT. All pilot data are available for reviewers. Please write to ana.trianahoyos@aalto.fi or researchdata@aalto.fi to request access.
* docs: 
* results: this folder stores intermidiate results. 
* src: source code for pilot analysis. 

You can find more info about each folder in their individual readme files.

# 1. Project description
This GIT contains the code and data collected for the Pilot phase of the paper "Longitudinal single-subject neuroimaging study reveals effects of daily environmental, physiological and lifestyle factors on functional brain connectivity". 
In this paper, we conducted a 19-week experiment with a single participant who provided frequently sampled data from three sources: MRI, behavioral, and cognitive. Over the 19 weeks, smartphones and wearables collected objective behavioral data outside the scanner, while the participant completed daily cognitive tests and mental state questionnaires. For 15 weeks, the participant also underwent two MRI sessions per week, collecting structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data.

We conducted three separate pilot studies to evaluate various aspects of our research project, including study feasibility, data collection system effectiveness, and participant tolerance to the protocol. The first pilot focused solely on behavioral data, testing the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and data collection feasibility using smartphones and wearables. The second involved the n-back task, aimed at identifying potential learning effects. The third combined MRI and behavioral data to evaluate MRI sequences, the quality of fMRI data, and participant responses to the protocol. Results from these data and analysis are reported in the Supplementary Information file of the paper "Longitudinal single-subject neuroimaging study reveals effects of daily environmental, physiological and lifestyle factors on functional brain connectivity" by Triana AM, Salmi J, Hayward N, Saram√§ki J, and Glerean E. The reported results are also available in the OSF pre-registration of the paper accesible at: https://osf.io/67tb4
