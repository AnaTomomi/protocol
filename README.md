This GIT contains all materials referenced in "Effects of daily environmental, physiological, and lifestyle factors in functional brain connectivity".

There are four folders in this GIT:
* data: contains data if it has been pseudononymized. Some data may be missing in this folder because it is not yet pseudononymized or because it is too big for sharing on GIT. All pilot data are available for reviewers. Please write to ana.trianahoyos@aalto.fi or researchdata@aalto.fi to request access.
* docs: 
* results: this folder stores intermidiate results. 
* src: source code for pilot analysis.
